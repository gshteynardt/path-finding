# Pathfinding Visualizer

A sleek and interactive **pathfinding visualization tool** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
This application demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithms explore the grid and find the shortest path between two points.

---

## Features

- 📍 Drag & drop **Start** and **End** nodes.
- 🧱 Click and drag to create or remove **walls**.
- 🛤️ Visualizes **BFS** (Breadth-First Search) algorithm.
- ⚡ Real-time **algorithm statistics**: path length, operations count, execution time.
- 🎥 Smooth and optimized **animations**.

---

## Future Improvements

-	~~Full implementation of Bidirectional BFS algorithm.~~
-   ~~Add adjustable **speed** control~~
-   Switch between **square** and **rounded** (hexagon-like) cell shapes.
-	Add Dijkstra’s algorithm.
-	Add Bidirectional Dijkstra’s algorithm.
-	Add **A\*** (A-Star) algorithms.

## Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS** (utility-first styling)
- **shadcn/ui** (for ready-to-use UI components)
- **Lucide Icons**
